- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/using-vite) - For styles

### What I learned

- Using @layer components and personalizing themes:
```css

```

- Using map to bring JSON Data:

```js

```

### Continued development

I will continue using tailwind and react as practice in my learning process even I could just use plain CSS and HTML to get familiar with these technologies.
